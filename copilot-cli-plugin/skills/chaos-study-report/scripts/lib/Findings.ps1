.SYNOPSIS
    Turn evidence into findings. Pure logic, no side effects.

.DESCRIPTION
    Every function here is a pure function of its arguments. No file access, no
    network, no clock, no `az`. That is deliberate: interpretation is the part
    of the pipeline most likely to be wrong, and the only way to argue about it
    is to be able to run it on fixed inputs and get a fixed answer.

    Two rules do most of the work.

    A control-plane success is not proof. Chaos Studio reporting a scenario run
    as Succeeded means the action was accepted and dispatched, not that it
    reached the data plane. Only a data-plane signal that actually moved can set
    mechanismProven, and without it the verdict is Inconclusive rather than a
    pass.

    A gap is not a zero. A signal that could not be read is null with a caveat,
    and it lowers confidence instead of quietly becoming a healthy number.

Set-StrictMode -Version Latest

# The findings contract version. v2 split the single verdict into a predicate
# verdict and a study verdict and gave every finding a kind, so a v1 findings
# file cannot be read as if it were a v2 one: its `verdict` conflates two
# questions and its findings have no kind at all. Comparisons across the
# boundary are refused rather than silently coerced.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Whether two findings documents can be compared without lying.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Same contract version compares cleanly. A v1 document has no predicate
        verdict and no finding kinds, so a v1-to-v2 delta would either invent
        the missing half or quietly compare a study verdict against a predicate
        verdict. Both are worse than refusing.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This is the proof that the fault reached the system rather than being
        accepted by the API and quietly doing nothing. It is deliberately
        resource-agnostic: the study compares the numbers it was told to
        collect, whatever they are, and reports movement in the operator's own
        terms.

        A signal has "moved" when a numeric value it reported in the baseline
        window differs during injection. No threshold is applied here - the
        question is only whether the system noticed, not whether it suffered.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Prove the frozen mechanism, not the accident of any signal moving.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This is the difference between "something changed while we were
        injecting" and "the specific thing the stated mechanism predicts
        changed, on the resource it predicts". It evaluates the exact
        mechanismProbe frozen at scope time over the actual action window's
        evidence only, and it looks at that probe's own signal - never any
        other. Unrelated movement can therefore never set mechanismProven true.

        The probe carries an expectedDirection:
          up          the probe's value is higher during the action window
          down        it is lower
          appears     it was absent before and is present during
          disappears  it was present before and is absent during
          crosses     it moved across the threshold named in condition

        And a resourceCorrelation: the resource the movement must belong to.
        When the study knows its scoped resources, the correlation has to be one
        of them; a probe that resolves elsewhere is not proof about this study.

    .OUTPUTS

        A stable identity for a finding, so the same issue matches across runs
        even when its wording changes.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The action URN is the preferred identity because it is what the service
        itself calls the action. It is not always available - a plan scoped with
        discovery skipped never learned it - so the key falls back to whatever
        identity the plan does carry rather than refusing to build a key at all.
        An unidentifiable action still gets a deterministic key, so findings
        remain comparable within a study even when they cannot be matched to
        another study's action.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        What happened to the one thing the study said it was testing.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This verdict is deliberately narrow. It answers exactly one question -
        did the declared steady-state predicate hold while the action was live -
        and it answers it from the measurement, not from how the study felt.

        Keeping it separate from the study verdict is the whole point. A study
        can do real damage while the predicate holds, and a study can leave the
        predicate untouched while everything else went fine. Collapsing both
        into one sentence is how a report ends up claiming "steady state
        breached" about a predicate that was never breached, or claiming a pass
        for a run that flattened something else.

        The ordering is by strength of statement about the predicate itself:
        an observed breach outranks everything; a missing measurement means we
        cannot speak; a predicate that held while nothing exercised it is not
        evidence of resilience.
