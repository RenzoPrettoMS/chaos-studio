description: "Run a complete Chaos reliability study against an Azure workspace scope: frame a falsifiable steady-state question, discover the actions Chaos Studio actually offers for that region live, freeze a plan, execute a validated scenario configuration with explicit consent, collect before/during/after evidence, and produce a self-contained HTML report. Start here for 'is my service actually resilient to X?' questions."

# chaos-study — reliability studies, end to end

Chaos engineering is an experiment in the scientific sense, not a stunt. This
skill runs it: it asks a question that can be proven **wrong**, executes a real
action against real resources, and reports what the evidence actually showed.

## The question this suite answers

> Does **`<steady state>`** hold when I execute **`<action>`** across
> **`<workspace scope>`**?

If you cannot phrase the goal that way, stop and reframe it. "Test resilience"
is not a study — there is no way for it to fail, so it cannot teach you anything.

## Principles

**A study is a falsifiable claim.** Every study needs a steady-state predicate
that is measurable beforehand and could plausibly break during the run.

**The platform decides what is possible, not this plugin.** The available
actions are read live from Chaos Studio for the workspace's region, every time.
This suite ships **no** action catalogue, and there is no offline fallback: if
the service cannot be asked, scoping stops with exit `16` rather than guessing.

**What is in scope is read from the service.** The resources a run will touch
come from the workspace's discovered resources, not from an assertion in the
plan. If the scope is empty, or the action applies to nothing in it, the study
is refused before anything runs.

**Evidence beats vibes.** A verdict is only as good as the signals behind it. If
a signal was not collected, the report says *not measured* — never `0`, never a
plausible-looking guess. Absent evidence is reported as absent.

**Nothing runs without consent.** `-DryRun` defaults to `$true`. Arming a study
takes both `-DryRun:$false` and typing back the exact phrase the plan prints.
There is no flag that skips this.

**Blast radius is bounded before it is armed.** Workspace, scope, filters,
exclusions, action, parameters and duration are frozen into the plan and hashed.
If the plan changed after you approved it, the run refuses rather than executing
something you did not review.

**A clean result is not automatically good news.** If the action never actually
reached the resources, "steady state held" means nothing. The report says
*Inconclusive* rather than claiming a pass it cannot support.

## The five skills

This is a suite, not a monolith. Use the front door unless you need one phase.

| Skill | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| **chaos-study** | chains the phases below; the default entry point |
| **chaos-study-scope** | workspace, scope, live action discovery, freezing the plan |
| **chaos-study-run** | configuration, validation, consent, execution, evidence |
| **chaos-study-report** | interpretation, findings, the HTML report |
| **chaos-study-history** | list, compare, and re-run past studies |

Each phase persists its own output, so a chain that fails partway can be resumed
from that phase — you never have to restart from scratch.

## Usage

**1. Ask the platform what it can do here.** The answer depends on the region and
what is in scope, and it changes as Chaos Studio ships new actions:

```powershell
./scripts/Invoke-ChaosStudy.ps1 -ListActions `
    -SubscriptionId $sub -ResourceGroup rg-prod -WorkspaceName ws-payments

./scripts/Invoke-ChaosStudy.ps1 -ListScenarios `
    -SubscriptionId $sub -ResourceGroup rg-prod -WorkspaceName ws-payments
```

Each action is printed with its canonical id, its type, what it applies to and
its parameter schema — all as the service reported them.

**2. Plan and preview.** This executes nothing:

```powershell
./scripts/Invoke-ChaosStudy.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId $sub -ResourceGroup rg-prod -WorkspaceName ws-payments `
    -Scenario '<scenario from -ListScenarios>' `
    -Action '<action from -ListActions>' `
    -SteadyState 'successRate >= 99.5' -SignalSource 'metrics:Availability'
```

Read the preview. It shows what is in scope after filters and exclusions, the
windows, and the configuration that would be created.

**3. Arm it.** Only after the preview matches your intent:

```powershell
./scripts/Invoke-ChaosStudy.ps1 ... -DryRun:$false -Consent '<phrase from the preview>'
```

The run creates and validates the scenario configuration, collects baseline,
executes, collects during, waits out recovery, then reports and seals the study.

## Reading the verdict

| Verdict | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Steady state held** | The action landed and the objective survived it |
| **Degraded but recovered** | Breached during the run, recovered afterwards |
| **Steady state breached** | Breached and still breached after recovery |
| **Inconclusive** | The action could not be proven to have landed |

Severity follows recovery, not drama: a breach that never recovers is `critical`;
the same breach that self-heals is `medium`.

## Choosing signals

The suite collects only what you name, because what counts as evidence depends
on the system under study. Two forms:

- `metrics:<name>` — an Azure Monitor metric on the single scoped resource, or
  `@<resourceId>` to pin one, `|<aggregation>` to override the aggregation. A
  scope holding several resources has no implied metric target, so pin it.
- `logs:<workspaceId>#<kql>` — a Log Analytics query

Name at least one signal that would be expected to *move* under the action. That
is what separates "resilient" from "the action never landed".

## Before you run against production

Scoping checks readiness first. A study whose objective cannot be measured, or
whose parameters do not satisfy the live schema, teaches nothing — so readiness
failure (exit `10`) is a real answer, not a gate to bypass. Exit `14` means
nothing is in scope or the action does not apply to what is; running anyway
would produce a false pass. Exit `16` means the platform could not be asked what
it offers, and the suite refuses to substitute its own list.

## Progressive discovery

Action identifiers, parameters and required permissions are **not** documented
here, because they are the service's to state and this plugin's to relay. Get
them from `-ListActions`. What lives here is the method:

- **`references/study-method.md`** — the five-phase method and why it is split
- **`references/report-contract.md`** — what the report may and may not claim

Kubernetes/AKS-specific guidance is deliberately absent: those actions are not
available from the actions endpoint yet. When they ship, they appear in
`-ListActions` automatically, with no change to this suite.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Error |
| `10` | Readiness gates failed |
| `11` | Consent declined or phrase mismatch |
| `12` | Plan changed after it was frozen |
| `13` | Study already sealed |
| `14` | Scope unverified — nothing in scope, or the action does not fit it |
| `15` | Studies not comparable |
| `16` | Live action discovery unavailable — there is no fallback |
| `17` | Scenario configuration failed validation |

## Notes

- Chaos Studio **V2** only: workspaces are the lifecycle root and resource
  selection flows through workspace scopes. There is no V1 path and no fallback.
- Core is `az` / Azure Resource Manager. There is no SRE Agent dependency and no
  required MCP dependency.
- Studies persist under a dated store, so later chats can list, compare, and
  re-run them. Sealed studies are immutable — re-testing scopes a **new** study
  rather than overwriting the record.
- Parameterised scenarios (`-Parameters`) are planned via `chaos-study-scope`
  directly; hashtables cannot cross the chained entry point.
