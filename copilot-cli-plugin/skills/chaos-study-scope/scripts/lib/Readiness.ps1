.SYNOPSIS
    Preconditions that decide whether a study's result will mean anything.

.DESCRIPTION
    Running a study is cheap. Running one whose result cannot be interpreted is
    expensive, because it consumes a change window and then produces a document
    that looks like evidence. These gates check, before any fault is planned,
    the conditions that separate those two outcomes:

      steady state    without a numeric objective stated in advance there is
                      nothing to breach, so there is nothing to pass either
      scope           the workspace has to have discovered something, or the
                      run touches nothing and reports success
      action fit      the action must be one the service reports for a resource
                      type in scope, with the parameters its schema requires
      observability   without a signal source the study can only prove the
                      control plane accepted the scenario run
      blast radius    a window long enough to observe, short enough to bound

    Gates are `blocking` or `advisory`. Blocking gates stop scoping with exit
    code 10. Advisory gates become limitations on the report - they weaken the
    conclusion without invalidating it.

    A gate that cannot be evaluated returns 'unknown', never 'pass'. The two
    lead to different next actions and collapsing them loses the distinction
    exactly when it matters.

    Nothing here knows what kind of resource is being studied. Every fact about
    the fault comes from the live action record discovered at scope time.

    .SYNOPSIS

    .DESCRIPTION
        A workspace whose scopes resolve to no discovered resources will accept
        a scenario configuration and run it to a clean Succeeded. Nothing was
        touched, so nothing broke, and the report reads like a pass. That is the
        single most misleading outcome this suite can produce, so an empty scope
        stops scoping outright.

        That verdict depends on having actually looked. When discovery was
        deliberately skipped the count is not zero, it is unknown, and the gate
        says so instead of failing: reporting "no resources" for a question we
        never asked would be inventing evidence. The plan then carries L10 and
        the run refuses to arm until discovery has confirmed the scope.
